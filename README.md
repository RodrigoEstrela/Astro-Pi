# Introduction
Our objective is to demonstrate the validity of Galileo's Theory of Relativity, from an experimental point of view, using the Raspberry Pi. By a mathematical model deducted we used the photographs of the Earth among the coordinates to calculate the relative velocity. As a secondary mission, we used the Humidity, Pressure and Temperature sensors to turn the RaspberryPi into a Human-Presence detector. We have used also be using data science methods to find the experimental error associated with the AstroPi device.
